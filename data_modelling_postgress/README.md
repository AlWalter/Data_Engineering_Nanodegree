<h3>Introduction</h3>
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

<h3>Project Description</h3>
This project includes an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

<h3>Song Dataset</h3>
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

    song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
    song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

    {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

<h3>Log Dataset</h3>
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

<h3>Files</h3>

<ul>
<li>create_tables.py -  drops and creates tables. This file can be used to reset the tables.</li>
<li>etl.ipynb - This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables</li>
<li>etl.py - reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into the database tables.</li>
<li>sql-queries.py - contains all sql queries.</li>
<li>test.ipynb - displays the first few rows of each table to check the database.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Database Schema</h3>

<h3>How to run:</h3>

Run the following commands in the project's root directory

To create the database and star scheme tables for ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database:
create_tables.py
To run ETL pipeline:
etl.py
Run the test.ipynb to test the results
